# JavaScript Pomodoro Clock
This a javascript pomodoro clock (built with Canvas) project from the Free Code Camp.

This pomodoro clock can:
1. start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
2. can customize the length of each pomodoro session and break.
3. can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
